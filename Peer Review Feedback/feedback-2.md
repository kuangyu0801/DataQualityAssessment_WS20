Review: Evaluation of Data Quality Assessment

In this review I will consider the following aspects according to a review guideline provided by the supervisors of this seminar: (1) positive aspects, (2) general issues, (3) specific issues, (4) other issues. In addition, I will provide a summary of the reviewed work based on my understanding of the work.


Summary

In this paper, the author aims to provide a summary and evaluation of commonly used practices for data quality assessment. Throughout his research, the author identified five essential data quality assessment methods, e.g., Total Data Quality Management (TDQM) as a means to support end-to-end quality improvement processes. The methods are evaluated against the type of data the methods support, included phases and steps, data quality strategies, quality dimensions, and involved costs. In the end, the author summarized the techniques and states that the comprehensive methodology for data quality management (CDQ) looks the most promising with respect to the analyzed properties. However, the author also claims that there are still issues that require further research, i.e., customizations of different data quality assessment methods to individual requirements and challenges in the domain of big data.

Positive Aspects

The author identified a lot of different evaluation practices in his domain of research. Further, the techniques and approaches are nicely visualized which helps in understanding the content.

General Issues

Structure: The abstract is not well structured. First, it mentions the contributions of the paper, leaving out the problem area and problem statement. The abstract should follow a cohesive structure, e.g., problem area, problem statement, contributions, a summary of findings or similar. The paper lacks a related works section as well as a section about the applied research method. It is advised that the author includes such sections to make the research repeatable and easier to comprehend the backgrounds.

Format: The format seems to be followed consistently.

Language: The paper should be checked for grammar and spelling. Using Grammarly helps to get rid of major grammar issues. Th


Specific Issues

Goals/Aims: The paper mentions the goals, however, stating precise research question(s) helps in better understanding the goals.

Presentation: Most paragraphs would benefit from better structuring, e.g., Section 2.2. which explains the major data quality problem. Instead of writing a large paragraph, using subsections would increase the readability. The paper includes a lot of graphics which seem to be simply screenshots from the literature. It seems that those graphics contain a lot of redundant textual information which is already explained in the paper, thus, simplifying the figures saves a lot of space and reduces the complexity of the paper.

In the conclusion, the author tries to connect the findings to the domain of CI/CD. However, a conclusion should never include new information, e.g., explaining CI/CD. This belongs in the fundamentals section. This also is done for various aspects in big data. The author should try to avoid explaining new topics in the conclusion and focusing on the findings.

Length: In total, the paper exceeds the maximum number of allowed pages (15 to 20) and should be shortened in general. Section 2 explaining the fundamentals feels quite large and is exhausting to read, hence, this section should be shortened significantly.

Research method: The author misses a section where his research method is explained. From the contents (and section title), I assume that a systematic literature review has been conducted. However, there is no information about how the author identifies literature and what inclusion or exclusion criteria he uses to select relevant literature. Simply providing this information helps in better understand the context of the research.

Clarity: The structuring of Section 4 makes it easy to follow the criteria by which the different approaches have been investigated, however, the explanations contain large blocks of text which are difficult to follow and often do not consider the summarized data in the tables given in the sections.

Result presentation: Section 4.1 types of data could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the findings summarized in table 2. Similar counts for the following tables in Section 4. The figures and tables seem to summarize the idea/approach sufficiently, however, most tables and figures contain a lot of textual data (especially the figures) which makes it difficult to extract the most important information simply by looking at the tables and figures.

Citation: At the bottom of the introduction there is a missing reference indicated by a question mark. This should be fixed by checking the reference in the document.

Is the goal/aim of the paper reached and sufficiently supported by the results presented: Further, lacking a precisely stated research question(s) makes it difficult to give a precise statement if the research goal has been achieved. However, the data looks promising and serves the purpose of the paper.

Other Issues

In Section 2.2. the author uses the abbreviation “DQ” but does not introduce it properly. In the same section, the author uses “we” which is not advised.
