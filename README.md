# Feedback
- From what currently is mentioned in the abstract, the motivation and the
context for the paper could be stressed more that a reader can judge
from the abstract what the paper is about and why you worked on that topic.


# Introduction

可以談到data quality的重要性, 與目前遇到的挑戰

In this section, the overview of this report will be presented. 
Then the following two points will be discussed
1. the motivation behind this report
2. a brief introduction of data quality assessment including its importance and challenges 

# fundamentals on Data Attributes
In this section, fundamentals and concept of data quality will first be reviewed and discussed. The topics included are definition, classification,
attributed, dimensions of data.
Secondly, the process and pipelines for analysing methodologies of DQ are introduced.
This topics regarding these methodologies includes strategies, techniques, dimensions, costs, data types, information system types

# Related Work
In this section, 5 state-of-the art data quality assessment methods are introduced in brief.
These methods includes : to decided.
# Evaluation
In this section evaluation in terns of process, techniques, and performances are disccussed across these 5 methods.
# Conclusion

This section summarizes all the topics in report. 
The conclusions of evaluation of different method is drew. 
From the best suitable methods, new ideas and customization are proposed to be adapted in the context of CI/CD application in software engineering.
In the end, the future work of data quality assessment for CI/CD application are proposed.

# Literature Review
## Data Quality Assessment
- Functional Forms
	- Simple Ratio.
	- Min or Max Operation.
	- Weighted Average.
- Assessments in Practice

Issues that arise when combining values associ- ated with different scale types (ordinal, interval, and ratio)

- Conclusion

one size fits all” set of metrics is not a solution.

## The Challenges of Data Quality and Data Quality Assessment in the Big Data Era

- 1 Introduction

However, the use and analysis of big data must be based on accurate and high-quality data, which is a necessary condition for generating value from big data. 
- 2 Literature Review on Data Quality

They defined “data quality” as “fitness for use” (Wang & Strong, 1996) and proposed that data quality judgment depends on data consumers.

“data quality dimension” as a set of data quality attrib- utes that represent a single aspect or construct of data quality.


- 3 The Challenges of Data Quality in the Big Data Era
	- 3.1 Features of big data
		- 4Vs: Volume, Velocity, Variety, and Value 
	- 3.2 The challenges of data quality
		- The diversity of data sources brings abundant data types and complex data structures and increases the difficulty of data integration.
		- Data volume is tremendous, and it is difficult to judge data quality within a reasonable
amount of time.
		- Data change very fast and the “timeliness” of data is very short, which necessitates higher requirements for processing technology.
		-  No unified and approved data quality standards have been formed in China and abroad, and research on the data quality of big data has just begun.
